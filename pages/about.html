            <h2>Introduction:</h2>

            <br>

            <p>Hi, I am a 15 year old sophomore from Washington State. My big 3 interests at the moment are technology, fashion, and music.</p>

                <h2>Technology:</h2>

                <br>

                <p>I plan on majoring in Computer Science in college, and eventually landing a job in the field.</p>

                <br>

                <p>At the moment I'm taking AP Computer Science A and Web Design at school. The technologies I'm learning include:</p>

                <div class="bulletpoints">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Java</li>
                        <li>HTML/CSS</li>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>Lua</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <br>

                <p>You can check out my <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> to see what I've been working on recently.</p>
                
                <br><br>

                <h2>Fashion:</h2>

                <br>

                <p>I was somewhat into clothing when I was 10-11, during the peak of the supreme/yeezy hypebeast era. I would always scroll through StockX after school and look at all of the different shoes and other clothing items. I was young though, so of course I didn't really have money to buy anything I wanted. Eventually, I just kind of stopped for whatever reason.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Around November 2021 is when I discovered <a href="https://reddit.com/r/FashionReps" target="_blank">r/FashionReps</a>. I got super into it and eventually ordered some things in late December. To this day I'm still pretty active within replica communities, even though I don't really buy reps that much at the moment.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Since then, I've started to use Grailed, Depop, Buyee, and similar sites often. Thrifting has been another thing I've done at least once every 2-4 weeks for the past year or so. Some of my favorite pieces are things I got from thrift stores for $3-10!</p>

                <br>

                <p>Some of my favorite brands are:</p>

                <br>

                <div class="bulletpoints">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stussy</li>
                        <li>Bode</li>
                        <li>Golf Wang</li>
                        <li>Patagonia</li>
                        <li>Kapital</li>
                        <li>Arc'teryx</li>
                        <li>And many, many, more!</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <br>

                <p>I've also started a small sidehustle reselling clothing that has allowed me to fund this addiction of mine. I mainly sell things on <a href="https://grailed.com/samcas" target="_blank">Grailed</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/trash" target="_blank">Discord</a>. Eventually I want to make a clothing shop website for fun to further my web development skills.</p>

                <br>

                <p>I've made a handful of friends through this hobby that I'm so thankful for as well!!!</p>
